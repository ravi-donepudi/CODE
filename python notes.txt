Recording a review of my python skills mostly based on what I need to quickly solve LeetCode problems

Classes and Objects.

Mutable and Immutable Objects:
Most python objects (booleans, integers, floats, strings, and tuples) are immutable. Lists and Dictionaries are mutable.
The __init__ method describes and contains all the initial data given in defining the object.
The __eq__ method is how equality or == is implemented for these objects
The __str__ method is how the object is printed under the print command.
The __hash__ method can be used to implement hashing of objects.

05/15
Hashes can only be used on immutable objects (makes sense since the function will change otherwise)
and or and not can be used on non-booleans too.

Import itertools
itertools.product does Cartesian product.

05/17
Quick way to count objects in an array and put counts in a dictionary
eg:
from collections import Counter
list = [1,2,3,4,1,2,6,7,3,8,1]
Counter(list)
Output:{1:3,2:2,3:2,4:1,6:1,7:1,8:1}
// can be used for integer division. Eg: 9//2 is 4.

Cmd+D to delete line (even if we're in the middle
ctrl+A to go to the start of the line

DFS for both adjacency list and adjacency matrix. Notion of scope and how it's important for nested functions. Solved problem of how to compute number of connected components of undirected graph from adjacency matrix.


05/20:
DFS more generally and not just on the defined data structure.
Bitwise operations: 
x&y,x|y and x^y are bitwise operations 'and' and 'or' and 'xor' 
~x returns -n-1 (I.e. switching all 0s and 1s
x<<y stands for x with it's bits shifted left  by y (Look at the direction of the arrows)
x>>y stands for x with it's bits shifted right by y (Look at the direction of the arrows)
Ask Naveen: If we do if f(x)==1: a=f(x), does this mean f(x) is computed twice
Queue is a list where insertion is done at one end and removal is done at the other end. Dequeue is a list where every end supports insertion and removal.
String formatting: Template: '%s,%n' % (string1, number1). %04d pads the digit with up to 4 leading zeros. %s can be used for strings and lists, %f for floats, %.4f for floats with exactly four decimal places

05/26:
Problem: Try to figure out the trick behind not having to traverse ground in a marking problem twice.
Eg: https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/

Can do chains of inequalities as booleans, for example 0<=a<=4
To add multiple elements say a,b,c,d to a list ls, we can simply do ls+=a,b,c,d
Union-Find data structure: Maintain a partition of a set (into disjoint subsets) and merging two parts of the portion (i.e. taking union of the subsets) when needed.
Eg: Can use to find cycles in a loop-less undirected graph. Initialize the Union-Find as a collection of singletons containing the vertices. Loop through edges and for a given edge e, check if both it's vertices are in the same subset in the union-find. If not, merge the relevant subsets. If they are, scream that there's a cycle.

While doing recursive assignments (such as Fibonacci nuts or reversing a linked list etc), use concurrent assignments to avoid temporary duplicate variables.

The global keyword can be used to indicate and modify a variable inside a nested function even if it is outside the appropriate scope. Very powerful but use with caution.

05/31

map takes an n-ary function and n iterables (like a list) and returns an iterable with the function applied to the sequence of iterables concurrently. If the input iterables don't all have the same number of elements, it results in an iterable with the same number of elements as the smallest iterable. Use list function to display the transformed iterables. Don't try to compare iterables directly. Always turn them into a list first.

06/01
Template for binary search in an array where arr[I] true implies arr[I+1] is true to find the minimum value in arr satisfying a certain condition.
Remember 3 things:
1. The range to consider: (left, right=0, len(nums) usually)
2. The return. left is the minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the condition function;
3.


left, right = 0, len(nums)
while left<right:
    mid=left+(right-left)//2
    If condition(mid):
	left=mid
    Else:
	right=mid+1
Return left

Bloom filters reading: A data structure for probabilistic set membership. It stores objects and when queried for membership, returns No or Maybe. Instead of using one hash function, use k hash functions on the object to store and mark the corresponding hash values as occupied in the hash table. To test membership of an object A, compute the same hash functions on A and check if all the computed hash values are occupied. If so, return a Maybe, otherwise return a No.

Few useful tips with pandas:
The following code returns a list of data frames, one for each table in the linked website.
df = pd.read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M')
To delete a column in a pandas dataframe df just do:
df.drop('column_name',1) or df.drop(['c1','c3','c4'],axis=1)

Started "grokking the coding interview" chapter 1: Sliding window.
Key takeaways: Hashtables can be handy in remembering where what is.
