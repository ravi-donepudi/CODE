Day 1:
Classes and Objects.

Mutable and Immutable Objects:
Most python objects (booleans, integers, floats, strings, and tuples) are immutable. Lists and Dictionaries are mutable.
The __init__ method describes and contains all the initial data given in defining the object.
The __eq__ method is how equality or == is implemented for these objects
The __str__ method is how the object is printed under the print command.
The __hash__ method can be used to implement hashing of objects.

Day 2:
Hashes can only be used on immutable objects (makes sense since the function will change otherwise)
and or and not can be used on non-booleans too.


Day 3: 
Import itertools
itertools.product does Cartesian product.

Day 4:
Quick way to count objects in an array and put counts in a dictionary
eg:
from collections import Counter
list = [1,2,3,4,1,2,6,7,3,8,1]
Counter(list)
Output:{1:3,2:2,3:2,4:1,6:1,7:1,8:1}
// can be used for integer division. Eg: 9//2 is 4.

Day 5:

Cmd+D to delete line (even if we're in the middle
ctrl+A to go to the start of the line
