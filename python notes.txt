Recording a review of my python skills mostly based on what I need to quickly solve LeetCode problems

Classes and Objects.

Mutable and Immutable Objects:
Most python objects (booleans, integers, floats, strings, and tuples) are immutable. Lists and Dictionaries are mutable.
The __init__ method describes and contains all the initial data given in defining the object.
The __eq__ method is how equality or == is implemented for these objects
The __str__ method is how the object is printed under the print command.
The __hash__ method can be used to implement hashing of objects.

05/15
Hashes can only be used on immutable objects (makes sense since the function will change otherwise)
and or and not can be used on non-booleans too.

Import itertools
itertools.product does Cartesian product.

05/17
Quick way to count objects in an array and put counts in a dictionary
eg:
from collections import Counter
list = [1,2,3,4,1,2,6,7,3,8,1]
Counter(list)
Output:{1:3,2:2,3:2,4:1,6:1,7:1,8:1}
// can be used for integer division. Eg: 9//2 is 4.

Cmd+D to delete line (even if we're in the middle
ctrl+A to go to the start of the line

DFS for both adjacency list and adjacency matrix. Notion of scope and how it's important for nested functions. Solved problem of how to compute number of connected components of undirected graph from adjacency matrix.


05/20:
DFS more generally and not just on the defined data structure.
Bitwise operations: 
x&y,x|y and x^y are bitwise operations 'and' and 'or' and 'xor' 
~x returns -n-1 (I.e. switching all 0s and 1s
x<<y stands for x with it's bits shifted left  by y (Look at the direction of the arrows)
x>>y stands for x with it's bits shifted right by y (Look at the direction of the arrows)
Ask Naveen: If we do if f(x)==1: a=f(x), does this mean f(x) is computed twice
Queue is a list where insertion is done at one end and removal is done at the other end. Dequeue is a list where every end supports insertion and removal.
String formatting: Template: '%s,%n' % (string1, number1). %04d pads the digit with up to 4 leading zeros. %s can be used for strings and lists, %f for floats, %.4f for floats with exactly four decimal places
